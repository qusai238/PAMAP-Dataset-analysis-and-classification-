# PAMAP-Dataset-analysis-and-classification-
The PAMAP two is an open source data set Created by the center for Machine Learning and intelligent Systems UCI, basically it is a dataset which has physical activity monitoring data of 18 physical activities which was perormed by 9 subjects wearing 3 internal measurement devices and a heart rate monitor. 8 subjects were male and one was female. and with respect to IMU they were the following ones:

sampling frequency: 100Hz

position of the sensors:

1 IMU over the wrist on the dominant arm

1 IMU on the chest

1 IMU on the dominant side's ankle

This dataset can be used for many scientifical research fields such as activity recongnition and intensity estimation while also applying algorithms for data processing, segmentation and feature extraction, All the data related to the sensors,heart rate devices and the participants can be found on their website if any further infromation is needed. So, here this dataset was used for data analysis and classification of Activities and then training different machine learning models which can classify the activities.So, the project is going to be divided into sections, first one would be exploring and cleaning the data to get some useful insights and plots, moving on, will by doing a hypothesis test between different features to verify some hypothesis about the data, and finally, a couple of machine learning algorithms will be fed with cleaned data and evaluated using this dataset.
